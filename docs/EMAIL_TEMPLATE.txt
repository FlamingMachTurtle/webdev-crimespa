Subject: Crime SPA Project - Week 2 Update & Setup

---

Hey Caiden & Charlotte,

I finished the API integration and form today (13/45 pts complete). Pull the latest code and pick which tasks you want to work on!

## Setup Instructions

**1. Backend Server (Project 3 - REST API):**
Clone/pull the latest version:
https://github.com/FlamingMachTurtle/webdev-rest

Read the README for setup instructions. Quick version:
- npm install
- Download database from tmarrinan/webdev-rest
- node rest_server.mjs

**2. Frontend (Project 4 - This SPA):**
Clone/pull the latest version:
https://github.com/FlamingMachTurtle/webdev-crimespa

Read **TEAM_UPDATE.md** in the root for:
- What's done (API + form)
- How to run both servers
- Task options you can pick from
- Timeline for Thu/Fri

## Quick Start

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
cd webdev-rest
node rest_server.mjs

# Terminal 2: Start frontend
cd webdev-crimespa
npm install  # first time only
npm run dev
```

Enter `http://localhost:8000` when the dialog pops up.

## Next Steps

Check TEAM_UPDATE.md for the full task list (25 pts remaining). Pick what you want to work on and let me know, or just start committing!

I'm free after 5pm Thursday if anyone needs help with setup or debugging.
